      "description": "One of my favorites.  This song is extremely fun song to play.  It's one of the more positive songs that I've written, but that doesn't mean that it's a soft one.  'A Better Day' is an upbeat rocker that's about finding yourself in a rut and fighting to get yourself out, while longing for better days.",
